# SMART BLIND STICK USING INTERNET OF THINGS
This project describes a cost-effective smart Stick using IoT (Internet of Things) for blind or visually impaired people. As these people find difficulties in detecting obstacles near them, while they are out of their homes all alone, which is very dangerous to them. This smart Stick comes as a proposed solution to enable them to identify the objects. In this project, we propose a solution, represented in a smart Stick with ultrasonic sensors to detect stairs, walls, and nearby objects in front of the user, within a maximum range of 3 meters. The Hardware components used in this project are Arduino Uno Board, Ultrasonic Distance Sensor, Piezo, Photoresistors, Potentiometer, Resistor and LED. Here we are using Arduino IDE which is a software component.
